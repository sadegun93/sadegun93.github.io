                My name is Stephen Adegun, and I'm a Fourth Year Game Design and Development student at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
                A lifelong lover of video games and writer, it's my dream to be able to create games and interactive experiences for people to get immersed in, enjoy, and use to ways to connect with others.
                Other than having a passion for game design and writing, I'm also a skilled programmer, being familiar with Unreal Engine, Unity, C#, Javascript, and C++.

                    During the Fall of 2021, I was part of a team of students working on a Virtual Reality game in Unreal Engine as a programmer. 
                    I programmed features of the game and debugged my colleagues' code, and facilitated weekly playtests to get feedback on the game and see how players felt about it.
                    The final build I worked on during the semester is available for download on the game's website.

                    During January, I was involved in the Global Game Jam, working alongside fellow RIT students and students from Japan's Kyoto Computer Gakuin.
                    Over the course of a few days, we were able to build this game. I was in charge of programming collision and player movement.

                    This is a project combining Javascript, Vue.js, Google's Firebase, Pok√©API, HTML, and CSS.
                    The project has two core functionalities. 
                    Users can make their own teams of Pokemon and uploading them to a database. They can also search for teams that others have built by searching for descriptive tags.
