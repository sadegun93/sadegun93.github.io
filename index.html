                My name is Stephen Adegun, and I'm a Fourth Year Game Design and Development student at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
                A lifelong lover of video games and writer, it's my dream to be able to create games and interactive experiences for people to get immersed in, enjoy, and use to ways to connect with others.
                Other than having a passion for game design and writing, I'm also a skilled programmer, being familiar with Unreal Engine, Unity, C#, Javascript, and C++.
