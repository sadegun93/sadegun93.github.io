                    I worked with a team of my classmates during the Spring 2022 semester to create a simple farming game. 
                    I programmed the core farming mechanics, including growing a single mushroom, allowing them to spread to other parts of the player's field, and hybridization, which sees new species of mushrooms spawn if players plant certain types near each other.
                    I also implented a simple calendar system, that progresses through the days and seasons as the player farms. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During the summer, I continued work on the game with one of those classmates.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The game's tutorial, having grown significantly during the summer, was something that I designed, as were its dungeons, which I also implemented.
                    There are a number of pets that act as livestock and grant the player buffs, which I was in charge of creating. I also made the game's enemies, some of which also have the ability to buff themselves or debuff the player.
                    Each of the game's NPCs has two unique lines of dialogue for every single day of the year, all of which was written and implemented by myself.

                    This Unity project was a collaboration between the Rochester Institute of Technology and the ArtCenter College of Design in California. 
                    Working as a member of an expansive team, I was charged with programming the game's dialogue system. I also built a system for spawning various waves of enemies, accounting for differing enemy rarity, spawning placement, and potential human error.

                    During the Fall of 2021, I was part of a team of students working on a Virtual Reality game in Unreal Engine as a programmer. 
                    I was mainly a UI Programmer for the project, working on the game's pause menu and synopsis, which updated with information about the game as the player progressed.
                    I also debugged my colleagues' code, and facilitated weekly playtests to get feedback on the game and see how players felt about it.
                    The game's most recent build is available for download on the website.

                    During January, I was involved in the Global Game Jam, working alongside fellow RIT students and students from Japan's Kyoto Computer Gakuin.
                    Over the course of a few days, we were able to build this game. I was in charge of player movement and magnetism, both of which were core to the game.

                    This is a project combining Javascript, Vue.js, Google's Firebase, Pok√©API, HTML, and CSS.
                    The project has two core functionalities. 
                    Users can make their own teams of Pokemon and uploading them to a database. They can also search for teams that others have built by searching for descriptive tags.
